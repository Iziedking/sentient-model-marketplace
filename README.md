# Open AGI Model Marketplace

> **Building the future of open-source AGI through transparent, decentralized model distribution**

A professional marketplace platform aligned with [Sentient Foundation's](https://sentient.foundation) mission to make AGI innovation open and accessible to everyone.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Innovation in AGI must be **open and accessible to everyone**. This marketplace demonstrates how open-source AGI models can be discovered, shared, and monetized in a transparent, decentralized ecosystem—moving away from closed-source systems dominated by private companies.

### Core Principles

- **🔓 Open Source First**: All models and infrastructure prioritize transparency and community access
- **🌐 Decentralized**: No single entity controls the marketplace or model distribution
- **💎 Fair Monetization**: Builders earn sustainable revenue while keeping AGI accessible
- **🤝 Community Governed**: Transparent operations with accountability to the developer community
- **🧠 AGI-Focused**: Supporting the next generation of open-source AGI pioneers

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Authentication**
- Sign in with **Google OAuth** or **email magic link**
- Receive **$25.00 in demo credits** to start exploring immediately
- No wallet or cryptocurrency required for the simulation

### 2️⃣ **Discover Models**
- Browse curated open-source AGI models
- Filter by: **Category**, **Rating**, **Price**, **Tags**
- Sort by: **Trending**, **Most Used**, **Top Rated**, **Newest**
- View detailed metrics: pricing, latency, usage statistics

### 3️⃣ **Unlock & Use Models**
- **Unlock models** with one-time access (free in simulation mode)
- **Run simulated API calls** to test functionality
- **Track costs** based on token usage (1,000 tokens per test call)
- **Rate models** to help the community make informed decisions

### 4️⃣ **Monitor Usage**
- View your **credit balance** and spending history
- Track **owned models** and usage patterns
- Access **detailed analytics** on your API calls
- Simulate **revenue scenarios** with the monetization calculator
